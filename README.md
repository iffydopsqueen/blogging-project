# My Blog Project

**My Blog Project** is the final project for my Back End Web Development course. This project was more focused on the implementation of backend components like login, signup, dashboard, add post, update post, delete post, etc.

## Technologies Used

- PUG
- SASS
- HTTPS
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Token

## Description

This project aims to create a robust and user-friendly blog platform where users can create, edit, and publish their blog posts. It utilizes `NodeJS` and `Express` for the backend, `MongoDB` as the database, and `Mongoose` for data modeling. The front end is built with `Sass` for styling and `Pug` as the template engine. `JSON Web Token` is employed for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the platform. Additionally, `HTTPS` is implemented to enhance security and protect user data.
